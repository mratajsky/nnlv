<h2>Configure Training Set</h2>
<p>
    The <em>Configure Training Set</em> dialog allows adding training samples using a simple table. Each training sample for a supervised network consists of input values and expected outputs of all output neurons. Unsupervised samples only contain input values.
</p>
<p>
    Training samples can also be imported from CSV files as well as XML files containing saved neural networks with compatible architecture. Exporting is also possible to both CSV and XML formats.

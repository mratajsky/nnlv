<h2>Input Space</h2>
<p>
    The <em>Input Space</em> panel displays geometric view of the input space. The training inputs are normally represented as dots and depending on the model, neurons may either be represented as dots according to their weight location in the input space, or by lines separating the input space into differently classified domains.

<p>
    This is the only chart that can be controlled with the mouse and keyboard. Moving the axes is possible by dragging the mouse while holding the left mouse button, or by using the arrow keys after giving the chart focus. Zooming is done using the mouse wheel or plus/minus keys on the keyboard. To reset the chart to the default view, use the middle mouse button, or the Esc key after focusing the chart. The <em>Reset Network View</em> action from the <em>Neural Network</em> menu also resets the view of this chart.

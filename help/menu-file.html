<h2>File Menu</h2>
<p>
    The <em>File</em> menu category contains the following options:
    <ul>
        <li>New: open the network wizard to create a new network</li>
        <li>Open: load a network saved in an XML file</li>
        <li>Save: save the current network to an XML file; this action is disabled if the current network was loaded from a file, but currently has no unsaved changes</li>
        <li>Save As: save the current network to the chosen location; this action is always enabled</li>
        <li>Close: close the current window</li>
        <li>Quit: close all windows and quit the application</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    Each program window may or may not be associated with a file. If it is, the name of the file is written in the window title bar and the <em>Save</em> action saves changes to this file.

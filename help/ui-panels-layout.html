<h2>Network Layout</h2>
<p>
    The <em>Network Layout</em> panel provides an overview of all the neurons in the network. Double clicking a neuron opens a dialog to edit the name, value and weights of the neuron. Some of these options are disabled during training.
</p>
<p>
    Double clicking a layer in the layout triggers an opening/closing action in the tree view. To rename a layer, select it and press F2. It is also possible to open a rename dialog from the right click menu. The F2 key and right click menu are also available with neurons.

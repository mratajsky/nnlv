        <li>Neurons in the input layer: number of input neurons</li>
        <li>Neurons in the hidden layer: number of neurons in the RBF layer</li>
        <li>Neurons in the output layer: number of output neurons</li>
        <li>Initial connection weights: choose whether to have the initial connection weights initialized to random values in the given range, or to use the selected value to initialize them; this only applies to the connections between the RBF layer and the output layer as the other weights are trained automatically when training is started</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    The <em>Training Options</em> section additionally contains the following options:
    <ul>
        <li>Learning rate: the learning rate constant in the range (0, 1]</li>
        <li>Training sample selection order: choose whether to select the training samples in a random order during training, or select them in the order they appear in the training table</li>
    </ul>

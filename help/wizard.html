<h2>Neural Network Wizard</h2>
<p>
    The Neural Network Wizard is displayed during the application startup and when the <em>New</em> menu action is used.
</p>
<p>
    The left column displays a list of all supported neural network types. By selecting one of the types, a list of examples is loaded and shown in the right column. To load one of the example networks, either double click it, or select it and press the <em>Finish</em> button. To create a custom neural network of the selected type, check the <em>Create a new network</em> checkbox and press the <em>Next</em> button.
</p>
<p>
    The <em>Load from File</em> button displays the same dialog as if the <em>Open</em> menu action was used. It is provided here for convenience.

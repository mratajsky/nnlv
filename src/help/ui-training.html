<h2>Training</h2>
<p>
    Use the training controls below the diagram to start, stop and control the training.
</p>
<p>
    When training is in progress, some parts of the user interface will be greyed out to indicate that
    the network properties are not adjustable during training. Ongoing training can be either paused or
    stopped, pausing doesn't cause the number of training epochs to be reset to 0 and in the case of RBF networks,
    it allows continuing training without re-training the RBF units, which otherwise happens each time training
    is started.
</p>
<p>
    The slider allows adjusting the delay before processing samples and therefore makes training slower or faster.
</p>
<h3>Training Options</h3>
<p>
    The <em>Training Options</em> dialog allows changing the training options which were provided at the time
    the neural network was created. It also provides a checkbox to pause the training after processing
    each sample.
</p>
<p>
    The <em>Stop Conditions</em> part of the dialog allows selecting which conditions have to be met to have
    the training process stopped automatically by checking the appropriate checkboxes and filling in the values.
    By default, no stop conditions are selected for new networks and training must be stopped manually.
